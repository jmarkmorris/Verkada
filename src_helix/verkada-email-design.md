# How to implement CH requirements

- set up a new agentic administrator in Verkada
- have LPoI events sent to the email address of the agent
- the agent needs to receive the email in real time
- scrape the relevant information from the email
- use the LP string as the key into the LPoI to email table
- create an email notification with the relevant information
- send the email

Yes, there is an API for Gmail that allows you to send emails and receive real-time notifications about email activity.

## Gmail API: Sending Emails and Real-Time Capabilities

**Sending Emails:**  
The Gmail API is a RESTful API provided by Google that enables developers to programmatically send emails, manage drafts, organize messages, and perform other mailbox operations directly from their applications. You can send emails using the `messages.send` method, either by creating a new message or sending from a draft. This API supports sending plain text, HTML emails, and attachments.

**Real-Time Email Updates:**  
For real-time email monitoring, the Gmail API supports webhook notifications. Developers can set up push notifications using Google Cloud Pub/Sub, which allows your application to receive real-time updates when new emails arrive, messages are sent, or other mailbox events occur. 

**How It Works:**
- **Webhook Setup:** You configure a webhook endpoint and subscribe to Gmail events via the API.
- **Push Notifications:** When an event (such as a new email) occurs, Gmail sends a notification to your webhook endpoint almost instantly.
- **Actionable Events:** Your application can then process these events in real time, such as notifying users or triggering automated workflows.

## Implementation Notes

- **Authentication:** Uses OAuth 2.0 for secure access.
- **Setup:** Requires enabling the Gmail API in Google Cloud Console and configuring credentials.
- **Limitations:** Subject to Gmailâ€™s API quotas and daily sending limits.

**In summary:**  
The Gmail API allows you to both send emails programmatically and receive real-time notifications about email activity, making it suitable for applications that require instant email processing and automation.
