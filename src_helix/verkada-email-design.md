Yes, there is an API for Gmail that allows you to send emails and receive real-time notifications about email activity.

## Gmail API: Sending Emails and Real-Time Capabilities

**Sending Emails:**  
The Gmail API is a RESTful API provided by Google that enables developers to programmatically send emails, manage drafts, organize messages, and perform other mailbox operations directly from their applications[2][3][4][6]. You can send emails using the `messages.send` method, either by creating a new message or sending from a draft[4]. This API supports sending plain text, HTML emails, and attachments.

**Real-Time Email Updates:**  
For real-time email monitoring, the Gmail API supports webhook notifications. Developers can set up push notifications using Google Cloud Pub/Sub, which allows your application to receive real-time updates when new emails arrive, messages are sent, or other mailbox events occur[1][7]. This is commonly used in CRM, ATS, and other integration scenarios where timely responses are critical[1].

**How It Works:**
- **Webhook Setup:** You configure a webhook endpoint and subscribe to Gmail events via the API.
- **Push Notifications:** When an event (such as a new email) occurs, Gmail sends a notification to your webhook endpoint almost instantly[1][7].
- **Actionable Events:** Your application can then process these events in real time, such as notifying users or triggering automated workflows.

**Third-Party Solutions:**  
There are also unified email API solutions like EmailEngine, which can connect to Gmail and other providers, offering a single API and real-time webhook notifications for all email activity[5]. These platforms simplify integration and can handle authentication, token management, and real-time updates across multiple email services.

## Summary Table

| Feature                  | Gmail API Support | Notes                           |
|--------------------------|-------------------|---------------------------------|
| Send Emails              | Yes               | RESTful API, supports HTML/attachments[2][3][4] |
| Real-Time Notifications  | Yes               | Webhooks via Pub/Sub[1][7]      |
| Read/Organize Emails     | Yes               | Full mailbox management[2][3][6]|
| Third-Party Aggregators  | Yes               | E.g., EmailEngine[5]            |

## Implementation Notes

- **Authentication:** Uses OAuth 2.0 for secure access[3][6].
- **Setup:** Requires enabling the Gmail API in Google Cloud Console and configuring credentials[3][6].
- **Limitations:** Subject to Gmailâ€™s API quotas and daily sending limits[3].

**In summary:**  
The Gmail API allows you to both send emails programmatically and receive real-time notifications about email activity, making it suitable for applications that require instant email processing and automation[1][2][3][4][7].
