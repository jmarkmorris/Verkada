## Key Sequence Shortcuts

- **Command Palette**: `Cmd + Shift + P` (Mac) - Access all available commands.
- **Quick Open**: `Cmd + P` (Mac) - Quickly open files.
- **Toggle Terminal**: `Ctrl + \`` (Mac) - Open/close the integrated terminal.
- **Find in Files**: `Cmd + Shift + F` (Mac) - Search across files.
- **Multi-line Edit**: `Option + Click` (Mac) - Place multiple cursors for editing.

  ### Detailed Explanation

  1. **Placing Multiple Cursors**:
     - By holding down the `Option` key and clicking at different points in your text, you can place multiple cursors in the editor. Each click adds a new cursor at the clicked location.

  2. **Simultaneous Editing**:
     - Once multiple cursors are placed, any text you type will appear at each cursor's location. This means you can insert, delete, or modify text in several places at once.

  3. **Selecting Text**:
     - You can also select text with multiple cursors. Hold `Option` and drag to select text across multiple lines. This is useful for replacing or modifying text blocks.

  4. **Using Keyboard Shortcuts**:
     - You can use keyboard shortcuts like `Cmd + D` to select the next occurrence of the current selection, adding a new cursor at each occurrence. This is particularly useful for renaming variables or changing repeated text.
