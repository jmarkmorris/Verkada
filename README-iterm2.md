# Starting Directory

To ensure iTerm2 starts fresh from your .bash_profile and doesn't open in a previous directory, you can adjust its settings as follows:

- Open iTerm2 Preferences (Cmd + ,).
- Go to the General tab.
- Disable "Restore Previous Session"

- there is a similar setting in vscode. Type cmd+comma and search on 'restore'
